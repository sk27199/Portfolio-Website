# Personal-Portfolio

A simple personal portfolio website created using HTML and CSS, designed to showcase my learning progress, projects, and interests in software development and cyber security.

# Project Purpose

This website was built to:

* Introduce myself professionally
* Demonstrate my growing web development skills
* Showcase programming projects I have created
* Provide a single place to direct employers to my work

# What I Learned

* Structuring a webpage using semantic HTML
* Creating layouts and styling with CSS
* Organising files correctly (HTML, CSS and images)
* Writing clean, readable code
* Linking between sections using navigation anchors
* Hosting a project publicly on GitHub

# Technologies Used

* HTML

# Future Improvements

I plan to add:

* More pages where I can display each project in detail
* Simple animations
* Dark mode
* JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic functionality
