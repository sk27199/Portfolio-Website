        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Shrish. I’m an aspiring Software and Cyber Security Apprentice 
            with a strong interest in how applications are built and how they can be made secure.
            I have a background in Business and Management and I’m currently developing my technical 
            skills through self-study and hands-on projects. I mainly work with Python, where I’ve 
            built projects covering both software development and security-focused concepts, 
            including API-based applications, database-driven systems using SQL, and security tools
            such as a port scanner and a password hashing system. Through these projects,
            I’ve developed an interest in writing clean, reliable code while also understanding security risks,
            secure data handling, and ethical use of tools. I enjoy breaking problems down into simple steps
            and improving my solutions as I learn more. I’m currently applying for Level 4 and
            Degree Apprenticeships in Software Engineering and Cyber Security, where I can gain real-world experience,
            learn from experienced professionals, and continue developing both my development and security skills.</p>
